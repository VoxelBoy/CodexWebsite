      <h1>Designing Sandbox City for Millions of Creative Players</h1>
      <p>Sandbox City started as a passion project: a place where creators could drop in, sketch a game mechanic, and immediately share it with friends. Scaling that idea to millions of players required a deliberate approach to system design, a relentless focus on iteration speed, and an obsession with giving players trustworthy tools.</p>
      <h2>Designing for safe experimentation</h2>
      <p>Sandbox City is driven by real-time simulation systems—physics, AI, economy, and social spaces—that players can bend without breaking. We built our runtime sandboxing layer on top of Unity&rsquo;s <strong>Entity Component System (ECS)</strong> so creators can author logic with high-level nodes that compile down to Burst-compiled jobs. Any experiment executes in an isolated world stream, and the engine only merges state back into the shared shard after validation checks succeed.</p>
      <p>This approach lets us ship new gameplay building blocks weekly. Designers define constraints as C# attributes in our authoring toolkit, while creators drag-and-drop behaviours that are guaranteed to perform. The combination keeps user-generated content safe and performant without slowing players down.</p>
      <h2>Scaling tooling beyond the core team</h2>
      <p>Internal tooling had to be just as polished as the player-facing UI. We invested early in a <em>toolkit guild</em>: a small group inside Sandbox City that maintains our scripting language, metrics dashboards, and release automation. Their mandate is to ship user-facing features only when the supporting tools are ready. That discipline means even our live ops team can spin up seasonal events without engineering help.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prefab recipes</strong> generate best-practice setups for creators and reduce the risk of misconfigured physics scenes.</li>
        <li><strong>Scenario replays</strong> capture Burst job traces so we can reproduce creator bugs in seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Zero-downtime publishing</strong> keeps community hubs live while updates stream in.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Lessons for other live UGC experiences</h2>
      <p>Working on Sandbox City has reinforced a few principles that apply to any live UGC platform:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Guardrails beat gatekeeping.</strong> Expose powerful systems, but bake in constraints so creators can move fast without risking the platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Invest in observability.</strong> Our creator analytics pipeline feeds directly into design decisions; without it, we&rsquo;d be guessing where to allocate engineering time.</li>
        <li><strong>Celebrate co-creation.</strong> Weekly community showcases and in-engine tutorials sustain the creativity loop.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Sandbox City is still evolving, but the foundations—ECS-powered tooling, disciplined live operations, and a focus on empowering creators—will keep it resilient. If you&rsquo;re building large-scale UGC experiences in Unity, I&rsquo;d love to compare notes.</p>
